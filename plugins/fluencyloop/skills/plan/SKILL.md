Plan a large chunk of work before building it: design and document the overall architecture, break it into task items, sequence them into a roadmap with a critical path, and (optionally) open GitHub issues under a milestone. Produces a committed plan.md that the per-feature loop then builds from — one feature per task item. Use when the work is too big for a single feature/branch, or when the user says "fluencyloop plan", "plan this", "design the architecture for", "break this down", or "make a roadmap".'

# Plan — map a big chunk before you build it

Sits **upstream of `$fluencyloop:feature`**. A *feature* is one branch; a **plan** is an
*initiative* that will spawn several features. You will: (1) frame the chunk, (2) design and
show the overall architecture, (3) break it into task items, (4) sequence them into a roadmap
with a critical path, (5) offer to open GitHub tickets under a milestone, (6) hand each task
off to `$fluencyloop:feature`. The plan is a **map you build against, not a spec to ratify** —
do not over-invest. Keep the developer the architect.

## Bundled CLI (Codex)

On macOS, Linux, Git Bash, and WSL, the trusted SessionStart hook maintains an owned
`~/.local/bin/fluencyloop` shim for this installed plugin. Invoke `fluencyloop …` directly so
Codex shows the readable command in its transcript. Do not resolve its path, check PATH, or
describe the shim to the developer.

If that command reports `command not found` because hooks have not run yet, invoke the bundled
dispatcher from the loaded skill path as a silent fallback. On native Windows, invoke the adjacent
`fluencyloop.ps1` with `pwsh`.

## Question delivery — preserve the pause

For a real answer, choice, or confirmation, use **`AskUserQuestion` in Claude Code**. Codex has
no equivalent question-form tool, so ask a concise standalone question in chat and stop; do not
create issues, write a settled choice, or advance the workflow until the developer answers.

**Understanding checks are self-report, never quizzes.** After teaching, ask only whether the
developer understands and whether anything needs clarification: *"Do you understand this
explanation, or should I clarify anything?"* Then trust their answer. Never ask them to prove
understanding by restating the mechanism, explaining it "in your own words," predicting behavior,
selecting an answer, or answering any other topic-specific question. Familiarity probes before
teaching and real technical choices remain valid, but they are not learning verification.

## 0. Preconditions

Run `fluencyloop check --json`. If `git_repo` or `fluency` is false, run `fluencyloop init --json`
without asking the developer. It initialises Git in the current project directory when needed,
then creates FluencyLoop's state. Only stop if `init` itself fails.

For that `fluencyloop init --json` command in Codex, request sandbox elevation before its first
execution. It may create or update Codex-protected `.git` metadata; do not first attempt it in the
standard sandbox.

**Read the constitution up front** — `docs/fluencyloop/constitution.md`, and **if it's a pointer**
(a `Source of truth:` line naming another file, e.g. `.specify/memory/constitution.md`), read
*that* file. The architecture you design in §2 is checked against it. If it's still the **empty
stub**, this plan is where the constitution is born — see §5.

**Load the learner's knowledge base** — parse it via `fluencyloop calibration show --json` (a
`dimension → level` map, level ∈ {`fluent`, `familiar`, `learning`, `new`}; per-developer, global,
never committed) — to set the depth you explain architectural choices at. Missing is fine.
Planning is also teaching: the same "teach the why, ask whether it is understood, don't lecture"
posture from `$fluencyloop:feature` applies to the architecture decisions here. Apply the
self-report-only rule above to every architecture explanation.

Is this actually a plan? If the work fits one branch, skip straight to `$fluencyloop:feature` —
don't manufacture an initiative. Plans are for chunks that genuinely decompose into several
features.

## 1. Frame the chunk

Take the user's initiative intent and scaffold the plan doc:

```bash
fluencyloop plan --json "<intent>"
```

This creates `docs/fluencyloop/plans/<slug>/plan.md` from the template **on the current branch**
(a plan is a committed doc, not a branch). Parse the JSON for `slug`, `plan_dir`, `plan`.

Nail down **goal, in-scope, and non-goals** with the user before designing — a plan's value is
mostly in what it excludes. Fill the `## Goal & scope` section from that exchange.

## 2. Design the architecture — *shown*, at initiative altitude

Draft the **big shapes**: the components/modules and their relationships, and the main flow(s).
This is coarser than a feature's `design.md` — the load-bearing structure the features will fill
in, not the per-feature detail.

**Show it rendered — don't just write a file and point at it.** Publish the architecture as a
**self-contained Artifact** (load the `artifact-design` skill first). The CSP blocks external
scripts, so render diagrams as **inline SVG** (or clean HTML/CSS) — do **not** pull Mermaid from
a CDN, and do **not** inline a minified Mermaid/JS bundle (its lone surrogates fail the deploy).
**Byte-check before publishing:** valid UTF-8, no lone surrogates / `U+FFFD`, JSON-round-trips
(prefer ASCII — HTML entities over literal dashes/box-drawing). Then walk the user through it and
invite reactions — this is a conversation.

**If the Artifact tool isn't available** (the environment can't publish one, or the deploy keeps
bouncing), **say so explicitly** — never silently skip the visual-design step. If this surface can
show a local self-contained inline-SVG/HTML preview, use that. Otherwise, do **not** substitute an
ASCII diagram or paste Mermaid source in chat. Point the user to **`plan.md`** and ask them to open
it in an IDE Markdown preview, for example VS Code's **Markdown: Open Preview** (`Cmd+Shift+V` on
macOS), where the Mermaid is rendered properly.

### Codex architecture teaching gate - before decomposition

After the architecture is rendered or sketched and before writing the task breakdown, roadmap,
constitution principles, or tickets, send a **user-visible architecture teaching turn**. This is a
hard ordering rule for Codex, not a status update:

This is a conversation pause, not a build or merge gate.

1. Walk through the main components, their boundaries, and the load-bearing flow. Explain the
   architectural choice and its rejected alternative, anchored to the rendered Artifact or Mermaid
   diagram in `plan.md`. "I have the architecture" is not teaching.
2. Set depth from calibration. If an architectural domain is absent from calibration, it is
   **unknown**: ask a neutral standalone probe and stop. Treat an answer such as "I am not
   comfortable" as `new`. For `learning` and `new`, explain the building blocks, the system flow,
   the architectural choice, and its rejected alternative; then ask the direct self-report
   understanding check and wait. Do not decompose the work or write settled architecture choices
   until the developer replies.
3. For `fluent` or `familiar` domains, the explanation may be brief, but it must still be visible
   before the plan becomes a task table. Capture the same rationale in `plan.md` only after that
   teaching turn.

The forbidden sequence is: draft diagrams in tools, then immediately write the architecture and
task table without explaining the architecture in the conversation. The durable plan records the
teaching; it does not replace it.

Persist the same diagrams as **Mermaid** in `plan.md` under `## Architecture` (blocks
**top-level**, never nested in another fence, so GitHub renders them). Check the shapes against
the constitution; if one conflicts with a principle, say so plainly in `## Constitution check` —
do not silently "fix" it. Refine once with the user's input, then move on.

## 3. Break it into task items

Decompose the initiative into **task items — each a future `$fluencyloop:feature`**. For each,
capture in the `## Task breakdown` table: an `id` (T1, T2, …), a slug-able **intent**, a rough
**size** (S/M/L), and its **dependencies** (by id). Aim for items that are independently
build-and-mergeable. Keep them coarse; a task that's really two features is two rows.

## 4. Sequence — roadmap & critical path

Order the tasks by dependency into `## Roadmap & critical path`:

- **Milestones / phases** — group tasks into shippable chunks in dependency order.
- **Critical path** — the longest chain of dependent tasks; the sequence that sets the earliest
  finish. Call it out explicitly (`T1 → T3 → T6`) so it's scheduled first and watched. Teach
  *why* it's the critical path — that's an architectural insight worth the developer holding.

## 5. Seed the constitution — if it's still the empty stub

Read `docs/fluencyloop/constitution.md`. **If it's still the empty stub** (`init` seeds an empty
`## Principles` — no real principles yet), this plan is the constitution's **birth**: the
architecture (§2) and roadmap (§4) you just drew are the richest early signal of what this
codebase values. Draft **3–5 initial principles** from them — the constraints and stances the
design actually evidences (a boundary the author insisted on, a coupling they refused, a quality
bar the roadmap protects). Each: a short **title**, the **non-negotiable** in a sentence or two,
and the **why** (the failure it prevents). Keep them **checkable** (*"no synchronous cross-service
calls in the request path"*), not platitudes. Show them, confirm, and write them into
`## Principles` numbered `§1, §2, …` — features cite these numbers.

- **Never author cold or pad to a count** — only principles the architecture evidences; fewer,
  sharper wins.
- **If a real constitution already exists** — a `Source of truth:` pointer, or SpecKit's
  `.specify/memory/constitution.md` — do **not** fork a second one; amend that in place following
  its own conventions (SpecKit carries a version + a Sync Impact Report).
- After birth it **grows** as features harvest principles from decisions (`$fluencyloop:feature` §3)
  — you don't need to make it complete here.

## 6. GitHub tickets — create them live, or offer a one-time `gh` setup

Check `gh auth status` **first**:

- **`gh` is available and authed** — offer to turn the task breakdown into **GitHub issues under a
  milestone** (one issue per task item; the milestone is the initiative), confirmed **per plan**:
  *"Create these N issues + the '<initiative>' milestone now?"* On yes, create the milestone then
  the issues (title = task intent, body = intent + dependencies, `--milestone` set) and record the
  links back into `plan.md` under `## Tickets`.

- **`gh` is missing or unauthed** — this is worth a **one-time** setup offer, because `gh` unlocks
  real automation. Check `~/.fluencyloop/preferences.md` for a settled `gh-setup` choice:
  - **Not settled yet** — offer **once** using the delivery rule above, and *sell what it unlocks*: with
    `gh`, FluencyLoop files your whole task breakdown as GitHub issues under a milestone **for you**,
    and opens prepopulated PRs at review — instead of you running commands by hand. Frame it so
    **yes** is the easy call, e.g. *"Want me to set up `gh` so I can file these N tasks as issues +
    a milestone for you? One-time — I won't ask again."* Options: **Yes, set it up** *(recommended,
    list first)* / **Not now**. Record the answer to `preferences.md` as `gh-setup: done` or
    `gh-setup: declined`, and **never ask again**.
    - On **yes** — install `gh` the way that fits **their** OS. Don't work from a hardcoded list of
      package managers (it rots); the canonical, always-current installer for every platform is
      <https://cli.github.com> — point there and pick the obvious command for their environment.
      Then `gh auth login` (uniform everywhere), and create the issues + milestone.
    - On **not now** — write the runnable `gh issue create …` commands into `## Tickets` and move on.
  - **Already `declined`** — don't re-offer; just save the runnable commands to `## Tickets`.

The plan is complete either way — no friction.

## 7. Hand off to the build loop

The plan is the map; each task item is built with **`$fluencyloop:feature`** (one branch per
task, from `main`), in roadmap order along the critical path first. Tell the user that — and that
`$fluencyloop:review` assembles each feature's PR view when it's done. Do not open feature
branches yourself here; §7 hands off, it doesn't build.

## Rules

- **A map, not a spec.** Don't over-invest — the plan is a shape to build against; the features
  are where it's ratified. Refine once, then start building.
- **Do not block builds or merges.** Pause only for a required learning response. Flag where the
  architecture tensions a principle; a plan is advisory scaffolding, not an approval checkpoint.
- **The developer stays the architect.** Teach the architecture and the critical path so they
  hold them; do not take authorship. Set depth from the calibration profile (§0).
- **Tickets are opt-in, per plan.** Ask before touching `gh`; fall back to a runnable script if
  `gh` is unavailable or declined.
- **Person-neutral, like the rest of the loop.** `plan.md` is committed — record the work, never
  anyone's competence. Per-developer knowledge stays only in `~/.fluencyloop/` (uncommitted).
